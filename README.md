# My Front-End Portfolio

This is my portfolio website, a minimalistic and easy-to-navigate page featuring the project I'm most proud of, technologies is work with, contact, and a little about myself. In comparison to my previous work, this project was at a little smaller scale, thus I could focus more on things like animations, reusability, and the overall smooth feeling of the website. Feel free to check out the page!

### Instalation

```
npm i
```

### Local Development

```
npm run dev
```

### Build

```

## Technologies I used

#### Framework: **React**

#### Styling: **Styled-componenets**

I decided to try myself with Styled-components to level up the reusability of the website. So far I think it's been a great tool, and I'm going to use it in many more projects from now on.

## Images and Icon Sources

I've decided to generate my picture with [Midjounrey](https://www.midjourney.com/) (based on my real photo) and I think it's done its job extremely well. The other photos of the projects were taken by me directly from my websites. All the icons I used were taken from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/). For customizing and optimizing pictures and their size I used [Resize Img](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image) and [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/).

## Inspiration

I've got to be honest, I've taken a little bit of inspiration about the overall page layout from the portfolio of **Ryan Registe** featured in Scrimba's video [Career Expert Reviews Junior Web Developer Portfolios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC9f_osm1mo&t=994s) (3rd portfolio on the vide.). Shoutout to Ryan for creating this genuinely perfect concept!

## Back-end

I've based my whole back-end, so all the projects, contact info and technologies in the online free back-end provider [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
